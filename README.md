#### Simple EC2 Node App

[EC2 Amazon Project Link](http://ec2-75-101-190-27.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)

This repo is a very plain and simple Node app. The purpose of this repo is not to demonstrate the steps on how to deploy
<br> 
it to EC2 (*directly inside EC2*), but rather to demonstrate that this repo has been deployed and hosted inside EC2. And, 
<br>
somehow show the technologies that were used on this Node application.

<br>
<br>

#### Technologies:
<br>

- **Node (Express)**
- **PM2** => *for managing processes when node app is running*
- **es6Renderer**  =>  *for the frontend template engine*
- **CORS, Helmet, HPP** => *security middlewares (backend)*
- **EC2** => *scalable virtual servers by AWS*
- **Nginx** => *web server used for this project inside EC2*
